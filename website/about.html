                Welcome to our visualization of Reddit comments!  Our inspiration was drawn from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets/comments/3bxlg7/i_have_every_publicly_available_reddit_comment/">the data that Reddit released in July 2015</a> for every publically available comment ever made.  Due to the massive amount of data that that dataset contained, we found and chose to use <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/reddit/reddit-comments-may-2015">a subset of this data</a> consisting of just the comments from May 2015, and further trimmed that dataset down to just the top 1000 subreddits in terms of number of comments made.  Our goal was be able to quickly view trends among subreddits throughout the month or days of the week, as well as to help users find other subreddits that may be of interest to them.
            </p>

                Our visualization consists of 2 charts.  You can select the subreddits that are shown in both charts by searching in the search box for a particular subreddit and then selecting buttons for ones you would like to see shown.  The default selected is the top 10 subreddits in terms of number of comments made.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The left chart is a stacked area chart that shows the relative number of comments made in all of the selected subreddits.  This can be used to see trends among particular days of the week for certain subreddits, such as the fact that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/">/r/gameofthrones</a> has a spike in number of comments every Sunday night, which is when the show airs.  You can click on a specific day and subreddit point to be taken to a query of that subreddit on that particular day in May 2015 so that you can see what was being discussed on that day on that subreddit.</li>
                <li>The right chart is a chord diagram that shows the connections of users who post in one subreddit who have also posted on other subreddits.  By selecting subreddits that you think you may be interested in and ones that you already enjoy browsing, you can see how many users post on the subreddits that you are interested in and the ones you already use.  For example, if you play the digital trading card game Hearthstone and enjoy that subreddit but are interested in trying out other trading card games, you can select subreddits for other popular card games such as Magic the Gathering (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/magictcg/">/r/magictcg</a>) and Yu-Gi-Oh (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/yugioh/">/r/yugioh</a>) to see which one might be a better fit based on the amount of users that post on those and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/">/r/hearthstone</a>.  You can click on the subreddit name on the outside of the ring to be taken to that subreddit to start exploring it.</li>
